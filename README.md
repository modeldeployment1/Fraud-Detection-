# Fraud-Detection-

A machine learning project focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions
Project Overview
This project is focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. Fraud detection is crucial for protecting customers and businesses from unauthorized transactions. In this project, I used various classification models to predict whether a credit card transaction is legitimate or fraudulent based on historical data.
The dataset contains two days of credit card transactions by European cardholders, with a small percentage of fraudulent transactions (0.172%). Due to the imbalance in the dataset, we employed special techniques to ensure accurate fraud detection.

How It Works
1.	Data Loading: We load a dataset of over 284,000 transactions, each labeled as legitimate or fraudulent.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Basic analysis is performed to understand the structure of the data, identify missing values, and analyze patterns in fraud versus legitimate transactions.
3.	Data Cleaning: Missing values and outliers are handled (though the dataset we use is clean).
4.	Dealing with Imbalanced Data: Since fraud cases are rare, I used oversampling (SMOTE), with oversampling ultimately balancing the dataset effectively.
5.	Feature Engineering: We transform certain features, like scaling the transaction amount, to make them suitable for machine learning models.
6.	Time-based Feature Engineering: Extracting more meaningful time features (e.g., time of day) might improve detection accuracy.
7.	Model Training: 
o	Random Forest
8.	Model Evaluation: Model is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure a balance between catching frauds and minimizing false positives.
9.	Random Forest Model: After testing, Random Forest was found to be the most accurate and reliable model for this project.

Results
â€¢	The Random Forest model achieved the best results with:
o	Accuracy: 100%
o	Precision: 100%, meaning very few false fraud flags
o	Recall:  100%, meaning it catches almost all frauds
o	F1-Score: Almost perfect, indicating a balanced performance

Future Improvements
1.	Hyperparameter Tuning: Further improvements can be made by tuning the parameters of the Random Forest or other models.
2.	Real-time Prediction: Integrating the model into an API for real-time fraud detection.
